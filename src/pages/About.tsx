            What STEM-Accessibility is
          </h2>
          <p className="about__p">
            STEM images—such as flowcharts, decision trees, process maps, and organizational charts—play a central role in how people learn, reason, and communicate. Yet they are still largely treated as static images, leaving many
            people without access to the information they convey.
          </p>
          <p className="about__p">
            STEM-Accessibility is built on the idea that accessibility improves when STEM image structure is made explicit. Instead of asking people to describe images after the fact, we treat STEM images as structured systems made up of
            nodes, relationships, and meaning. This allows a single STEM image to be expressed in multiple accessible
            forms, including long descriptions, keyboard-navigable views, and tactile or auditory outputs—without losing
            the underlying logic.

            The problem
          </h2>
          <p className="about__p">
            For many blind and disabled learners, STEM images remain one of the most persistent barriers to understanding
            course material, documentation, and decision-making tools. When STEM images are inaccessible, access is
            delayed, partial, or missing entirely.
          </p>
          <p className="about__p">
            Today, accessibility often relies on manual, one-off fixes: writing ad-hoc descriptions, retrofitting images,
            or relying on individual expertise without shared tools or structure. This approach doesn’t scale, and it
            rarely supports deeper understanding of how a STEM image actually works.
          </p>
          <p className="about__p">
            At the same time, the responsibility for providing accessible STEM images often falls on people who are not
            accessibility experts—or who did not originally design the STEM image and may lack deep domain knowledge of its
            content. Existing accessibility guidance for STEM images is often fragmented, underspecified, or focused on
            minimum requirements rather than on what it actually means to understand a STEM image. As a result, STEM images
            may technically meet guidelines while still failing to provide real access.

            Our approach
          </h2>
          <p className="about__p">
            STEM-Accessibility extracts STEM image structure from images and enables STEM images to be explored, verified, and
            transformed across multiple modalities. This approach supports clearer descriptions, more reliable
            navigation, and representations that align with how people reason about STEM images—not just how they look.
          </p>
          <p className="about__p">
            The accessible representations produced by STEM-Accessibility are grounded in accessibility research. We are collecting solutions from multiple papers that address these issues.

            STEM-Accessibility is designed for educators, researchers, instructional designers, and organizations that rely on

            make that possible.
